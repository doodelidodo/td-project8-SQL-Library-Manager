# Treehouse Techdegree - Project 8 - SQL Library Manager

In this project shows an Express / SQL CRUD App with pug as the View layer.
You can add, update and delete Books. As an extra there is a search function.
The pagination is also an extra feature.

I added also css classes to style the search and the pagination.

### To start the app
1. switch to the sql-library-manager folder
2. npm install
3. npm start
